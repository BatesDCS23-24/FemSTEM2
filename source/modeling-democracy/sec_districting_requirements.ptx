		<title>What makes a good district?</title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
			Analyze the different measures we have the complexity. Talk about some of the requirements states have for districting. 

			Discussion idea: have students google their favorite states requirements for homework before class and identify at least one requirement. Then discuss how they think math could be used to measure that (or if that's even possible/why do they think so). 	
			</p>

			<p>
				Make an exercise around <url href="https://districtr.org/utah#draw" />
			Then use this exercise to motivate students to discuss their own rules of "fairneess" for a district.
			</p>

			<p>
				Discussion idea: Brainstorm ideas you think would make a good measurement of compactness (how not spread out the data is). See W3A of AMS gerrymandering for more discussion topic ideas.
