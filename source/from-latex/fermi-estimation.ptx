			<term> 1</term>.  (TPS; <term>Reading Question</term>) Bob Moses is a veteran of the Civil Rights Movement and a 
			former leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a major Civil Rights Movement organization 
			dedicated to community organizing. He is also a math educator and founder of the Algebra Project, which works to 
			promote mathematical literacy among low-income students and students of color. Please read the attached chapter 
			from Moses’ book, <em>Radical Equations</em>, entitled <q>Algebra and Civil Rights</q>. While reading, think about your sense of 
			the connections between mathematics and civil rights, equity, fairness, and justice. Then answer the questions below.

			<li>
					<p>
			In your own words, why does Moses believe that the most urgent social issue affecting poor people and people of color is economic access and that economic access and full citizenship depend crucially on math and science literacy (p. 5)?
		</p>
			</li>



			<li>
					<p>
			How do you react to Moses’ assertion that not being ’good’ in math does not in any way imply inferiority, rather, it confirms that you’re just like most everyone else (p. 10)? How does this assertion connect to growth mindset and productive failure?
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			How have the issues Moses discussed changed since his book was published in early 2002? How have they stayed the same?
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			In what ways is Moses’ approach to the Algebra Project similar to and different from his approach to the civil rights movement? Explain.
		</p>

Take a ranked-choice class vote between these four. <term>Voters pick a first-choice candidate and have the option to rank backup candidates in order of their choice: second, third, and so on. If a candidate receives more than half of the first choices, that candidate wins, just like in any other election. However, if there is no majority winner after counting first choices, the race is decided by an instant runoff. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who picked that candidate as ‘number 1’ will have their votes count for their next choice.

			<term> 5</term>.  [Reading Question: CSM Exercise 1.8.2] In his May 17, 2010 op-ed column in The New York Times Bob Herbert noted that the dropout rate for American high school students was one every 26 seconds. [R10] Is this number reasonable?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Let’s estimate.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			First, how many American high school students are there? We’ll assume this corresponds with the proportion of Americans between ages <m>14</m> and <m>18</m>, inclusive. This is probably between <m>5</m> and <m>15\%</m> of Americans.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We use a geometric mean to get a single estimate: <me>\begin{aligned}
5\% &amp; =5\times10^{0}\%\\
15\% &amp; =1.5\times10^{1}\%\\
\text{geometric mean} &amp; =\frac{1.5+5}{2}\times10^{0.5}=3.25\times10^{0.5}\approx10\%.
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			around <m>10\%</m> (guess) of Americans, and there are about <m>300</m> million Americans, so we estimate that there are <me>.1\times300,000,000=30,000,000</me> American high-school students each year. Our answer here is <q>tens of millions</q>, which fits with the actual number of about <m>56.6</m> million. [Note that we don’t round; we just count the number of zeroes, which here is <m>7</m>, meaning our answer is <q>tens of millions</q>.]
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Assume that <m>20\%</m> (perhaps a high estimate) of American high-school students drop out each year. That’s <me>.2(30,000,000)=6,000,000</me> dropouts per year.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We convert to dropouts per second: <me>\frac{6,000,000\text{ dropouts}}{\text{year}}\times\frac{1\text{ year}}{365\text{ days}}\times\frac{1\text{ day}}{24\text{ hours}}\times\frac{1\text{ hour}}{60\text{ min}}\times\frac{1\text{ min}}{60\text{ sec}}=0.19\approx\frac{0.2\text{ dropouts}}{\text{second}}.</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Finally, we compute <me>\frac{0.2\text{ dropouts}}{\text{second}}\times\frac{26\text{ seconds}}{1\text{ 26-second period}}=\frac{5.2\text{ dropouts}}{\text{26-second period}}</me> which is higher (rounded up) than Herbert’s estimate. However, we note that we purposefully overestimated the dropout rate in order to be generous to Herbert’s estimate, so we could easily be off by a factor of <m>5</m> (<m>1</m> vs. <m>5.2</m> dropouts per <m>26</m> seconds).

					<p>
			In order to verify claims made in the media, to compute how much sea level rise would be associated with a <m>1^{\circ}</m> rise in global sea temperature, or to test whether the claims Trump makes in his next State of the Union address are correct, it’s essential to have an ability to estimateto lie (or oversimplify) skillfully and in a way that lets us better understand the truth.

			<li>
					<p>
			<term>Estimation</term>round up or down to make calculations easier and numbers less messy. As we saw when estimating the number of classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a calculator, it’s best to plug into the calculator before rounding, whereas if you’re computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic mistakesyou’ll see me do it plenty of times!

					<p>
			<term>Dimensional analysis</term>: start with the given and multiply by fractions, canceling out the units, until you get something in the units your answer should be in. This is almost always your answer!

			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Why bother with Fermi estimates, if your estimates are likely to be off by a factor of 2 or even 10? Often, getting an estimate within a factor of 10 or 20 is enough to make a decision. So Fermi estimates can save you a lot of time, especially as you gain more practice at making them.

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Tips for estimation:
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Change the rules to make arithmetic easier. There weren’t exactly <m>300</m> million Americans in <m>2007</m>the actual population was something like <m>301.2</m> million. But since we’re just giving an estimate anyway, we don’t care about the <m>1.2</m>. We <term>round</term> to the nearest hundred million!
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			For this reason, we only care about how many zeroes your answer has, not the actual number. So for our purposes <term><m>1,000,000</m> and <m>9,000,000</m> are the same</term> because they give us the answer of <q>millions</q>.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Writing all those zeroes can get unwieldy, so we use <term>scientific notation</term>: <m>1</m> with <m>14</m> zeroes after it is the same as <m>1\times10^{14}</m>. Nine with seventy zeroes after it is written <m>9\times10^{70}</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			<term>Divide and conquer</term>: split the problem up by first figuring out all the things we need to know, then using those things in some order to get an answer.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			<term>Use ranges.</term> If you feel fairly confident that there are between <m>1000</m> and <m>300000</m> Americans who don’t like Harry Potter (between <m>1\times10^{3}</m> and <m>3\times10^{5}</m> in scientific notation), average the exponents and the single-digit numbers to get your estimate. Here we’d average <m>1</m> and <m>3</m> to get <m>2</m> and <m>3</m> and <m>5</m> to get <m>4</m>, so your answer would be <m>2\times10^{4}=20,000</m> Americans.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			This is called taking a <term>geometric mean</term>, which is easier to take than a <q>regular</q> average when dealing with big numbers and exponents.
		</p>
			</li>

		</ul></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			<term>Look up related data</term>, if it’s available, to check the reasonableness of your estimation. For example, when estimating the number of active COVID-19 cases in SLC, you could look up scientific estimates of the proportion of COVID-19 cases that are reported, multiply that proportion by the population of SLC, and see if it’s in the same ballpark (same number of zeroes) as your estimate.

(Worksheet on Canvas) Estimation. <term>No computers/looking up allowed bc the goal is to practice a skill that is useful when we don’t have real-world data!</term> Divide the students into teams of 3-4. Each team starts on one of the first seven estimates with instructions to move on to the next one when done, circling back to Google search if they reach the end of the list. The teams start in different places, so after about half an hour the class has found two or three estimates for each of the seven tasks. The different answers for each task should have the same order of magnitude. If they don’t, we try to figure out why not. (Good to have poster paper or whiteboards for this)

			The tax rate on the non-capital gains income would be <m>\$150,000</m> plus <m>40\%</m> of the amount over <m>\$500,000</m>. Since the non-capital gains income totals <m>\$1,500,000</m>, the amount over <m>\$500,000</m> is <m>\$1</m> million. So the tax on the non-capital gains income would be <me>\$150,000+0.4(\$1,000,000)=\$150,000+\$400,000=\$550,000.</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Thus, the total tax paid by the average member of the <m>1\%</m> is <m>\$550,000+\$200,000</m>. To find the tax <em>rate</em> paid, we have to figure out what percent of their income this average <m>1</m>-percenter paid. They paid <m>\$750,000</m> in taxes, and their income was <m>\$2.5</m> million, so they paid a tax rate of <me>\frac{\$750,000}{\$2,500,000}\times100\%=30\%.</me>

			Average tax rate for an American teacher.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			The average teacher earns <m>\$60,000</m> a year. This means their tax rate is <m>\$14,000</m> plus <m>25\%</m> of the amount over <m>\$80,000</m>. Since there’s no amount over <m>\$80,000</m>, this teacher pays <m>\$14,000\approx\$15,000</m> in taxes.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			<m>\$15,000</m> is <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> or <m>25\%</m> of the teacher’s income of <m>\$60,000</m>.

			Is Joe Biden’s statement reasonable?

			<li>

			The teacher’s tax rate looks at first glance to be smaller than the top <m>1\%</m>er’s tax rate, but note we estimated. Both of our answers are in ”tens of thousands”, so we can’t
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			Due to potential estimation error, it’s actually reasonable that Biden’s statement is true.

			How to define a <q>mass shooting</q>?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			No official definition: at least <m>4</m> killed? <m>4</m> injured? Including shooter or not? Including violence due to drugs/gangs?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Estimate the number of mass shootings in <m>2018</m>: between <m>10=1\times10^{1}</m> and <m>100=1\times10^{2}</m>. Take the geometric mean: <m>1\times10^{1.5}\approx30</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Estimate the number of Americans killed in each mass shooting: say <m>5</m> on average. So a total of <me>5\times30=150</me> Americans are estimated to have been killed by mass shootings in <m>2018</m>.
		</p>

			Number of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants in <m>2018</m>.

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Note that no data exists.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Given that there were <m>15,000</m> murders total, we need to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants in the US in <m>2018</m>, as a percentage of the population. Say between <m>1</m> and <m>10\%</m>, with geometric mean <m>3\%</m>. Very close to the real number!
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			You may have heard the (true) claim that undocumented Americans commit crimes at a lower rate than documented Americans.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Even if you assume the rate is the same, that means that <m>3\%</m> of the <m>15,000</m> murders, or <me>.03(15000)=450\approx500</me> murders were committed by undocumented immigrants in <m>2018</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Both the mass shooting and murder numbers are in the hundreds, so there’s absolutely no evidence for the <q>tens of thousands</q> claim made in the post.

			# of Americans arrested each second for possession of weed alone from 2001-2010.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			We know about <m>600,000</m> Americans were arrested for weed alone in <m>2010</m>. Assuming weed policies were more lenient in <m>2010</m> than in <m>2001</m>, we’d guess maybe an average of at most <m>1,000,000</m> Americans a year over this <m>10</m>-year period, for a total of <me>10\times1,000,000=10,000,000</me> Americans arrested.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We now estimate seconds/year: <me>1\text{ year}\times\frac{350\text{ days}}{\text{year}}\times\frac{25\text{ hours}}{\text{day}}\times\frac{60\text{ min}}{\text{hr}}\times\frac{60\text{ sec}}{\text{min}}=30,000,000\text{ sec}.</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			This means that there were <me>\frac{10,000,000}{30,000,000}\approx0.3\text{ arrests/sec}</me> or about one arrest every <m>3</m> sec.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Now note that multiple people could be swept up in a single pot bust. Assume <m>2</m> people on average per bust, that gives <me>0.3\frac{\text{arrests}}{\text{sec}}\times\frac{1\text{ bust}}{2\text{ arrests}}=0.15\frac{\text{busts}}{\text{sec}}</me> or <m>15</m> busts every <m>100</m> sec. This is on the same order of magnitude as the ACLU’s estimate, so their estimate is reasonable.

			<term> 10</term>.  [or next time] Please read Sections 2.1-2.2 of Common Sense Mathematics, on units and MPG, then answer the following questions. Bring your answers to class on the date below for discussion.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			There are about 3.8 liters in a gallon and about 1.6 kilometers in a mile. If a car can travel 30 miles for every gallon of gas it burns, approximately how many kilometers can it travel per liter of gas? Just like in Section 2.1 of Common Sense Mathematics, write out your units and cancel units just like you would cancel zeroes in a fraction. Hint: start with <m>30\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}</m>. Then multiply by a number with units <m>\frac{\text{kilometers}}{\text{miles}}</m> in order to cancel the miles and replace it with kilometers.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			If a car can travel 30 miles per gallon of gas, how many gallons of gas does the car need to travel one mile? Show all work and units, cancelling units when needed.
