As we saw when estimating the number of classrooms needed for the US household wealth, rounding before the computation ends can introduce error. Therefore, if you have a calculator, it’s best to plug into the calculator before rounding, whereas if you’re computing by hand, rounding may be necessary in order to increase the accuracy of your computations. Everyone makes arithmetic mistakesyou’ll see me do it plenty of times!</div></li>

<li><div class="para">Why bother with Fermi estimates, if your estimates are likely to be off by a factor of 2 or even 10? Often, getting an estimate within a factor of 10 or 20 is enough to make a decision. So Fermi estimates can save you a lot of time, especially as you gain more practice at making them.</div></li>
