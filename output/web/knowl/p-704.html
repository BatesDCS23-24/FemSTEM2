<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">“This means that we are going to have to learn to think in radical terms. I use the term radical in its original meaninggetting down to and understanding the root cause. It means facing a system that does not lend itself to your needs and devising means by which you change that system.”</div></li>

<div class="para">In your own words, why does Moses believe that the most urgent social issue affecting poor people and people of color is economic access and that economic access and full citizenship depend crucially on math and science literacy (p. 5)?</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">According to Moses, economic access is needed to lift marginalized and inner-city residents out of violence and criminalization.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Moses states that the need for “knowledge workers” is a primary trend of the contemporary economy, earning <span class="process-math">\(82\%\)</span> more than workers in other industries.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Moses argues that “illiteracy in math is acceptable the way illiteracy in reading and writing is unacceptable”, causing a socially-constructed lack of fluency in math.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">“Math illiteracy is not unique to Blacks the way the denial of the right to vote in Mississippi was. But it affects Blacks and other minorities much, much more intensely, making them the designated serfs of the information age just as the people that we worked with in the s on the plantations were Mississippi’s serfs then.”</div></li>

<div class="para">“How do the people at the bottom get into the mix?”</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-roman"><li><div class="para">Why the underlying assumption that marginalized groups should “get into the mix” instead of changing the structure of the mix, getting rid of the mix entirely and starting something new?</div></li></ol></div>

<div class="para">How do you react to Moses’ assertion that not being ’good’ in math does not in any way imply inferiority, rather, it confirms that you’re just like most everyone else (p. 10)? How does this assertion connect to growth mindset and productive failure?</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">address the fallacy that not trying “hard enough” at math means setting yourself up for failure</div></li>
