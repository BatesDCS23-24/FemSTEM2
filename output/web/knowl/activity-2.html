<div class="para">Letâ€™s look back at our work and see if we can draw some conclusions, both about data visualization and about our story regarding anti-trans legislation in 2023. \begin{enumerate} \item For each graph you generated, what were the variables involved? Were they quantitative or categorical? Which graphs contribute toward our understanding of our question? \item Which types of graphs did you choose? Compare your choices to the variables you compared. What do you notice? Write a guideline to help select one or more graph types based on the data you are examining. \item Based on what you found, write one or two sentences summarizing our findings so far regarding anti-trans legislation in 2023. \end{enumerate}</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-leg-visualize.html#activity-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
