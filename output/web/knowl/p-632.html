<div class="para">In order to simplify the following charts and analysis, we combine certain bill statuses into categories: bills that have crossed over, passed, or were signed and enacted have a significant chance of impacting the lives of trans and nonbinary people in that state, while bills that were vetoed, died, or failed have no chance of impacting lives. Bills listed simply as “introduced” may or may not have the support to eventually pass, but since they are not currently impacting the ability of trans/nonbinary people to access healthcare, play sports, etc., we count them as “Not Passed”.</div>
