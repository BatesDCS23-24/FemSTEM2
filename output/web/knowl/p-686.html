<div class="para">The National Survey of Student Engagement, 2004, has found that undergraduate students are often passionate about social and political issues; the author argues that bringing such issues into the mathematics classroom can increase student engagement and performance. This provides evidence against the criticism often leveled against social justice pedagogy in mathematics that it necessarily would not focus enough on mathematical proficiency. The author provides a model of social justice pedagogy in STEM courses which introduces sociocultural phenomena through readings, videos, and activities, then the students would be given a problem and a structured worksheet to apply mathematics to the problem. Finally, students interpreted their mathematical solution in the context of the original issue, often leading to discussion about the broader implications of their solution. In this study, the author applies this model to precalculus classes, teaching functions, graphing, and statistics through examining political corruption and economic development worldwide, climate change in Zimbabwe and its impact on agriculture, and water security and native peoples’ rights in Botswana, to name a few. Winter derives several principles for social justice education from Marilyn Frankenstein (1990), including using real situations and real information, emphasizing situations that students might have learned about through news or other media, and using controversial materials to help students increase their curiosity, understand other perspectives more accurately, solve problems more effectively, and generate creative ideas (Johnson and Johnson, 1979). Students taught using the social justice approach performed statistically significantly better than a control group; they performed better on a mathematical assessment (exceeding the control group’s scores by 11.9%) and had fewer students with a grade of D or lower in the class (15.4% in the social justice pedagogy condition, as opposed to 22.9% in the control group).</div>
