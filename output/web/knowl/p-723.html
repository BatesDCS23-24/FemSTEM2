<div class="para">This article, adapted from a lecture by the author, discusses the author and colleagues’ experiences in trying to improve the performances (as measured by GPA and test scores) of students of color in calculus classrooms at UC-Berkeley. In the mid-1970s, when the author began his work, 60% of Black students enrolled in calculus at Berkeley received a D or F. The author’s initial conception of the reasons for this poor performance named student motivation, inadequate preparation, lack of family support, and income gaps as the culprits. Through interviews, Treisman realized the average student of color at Berkeley was highly motivated, that even students of color with high SAT scores (a measure of "prior preparedness") were failing, and that students of color often had very supportive parents, though often they had lower incomes. However, Treisman noticed that the difference between (primarily) Black students who were failing and the Chinese students he studied who were getting higher grades was amount of time spent working outside of class and amount of group collaboration outside of class. Treisman implemented an "anti-remedial program" (368) for students who saw themselves as well-prepared to provide students with a challenging, collaborative, community-based learning environment, which emphasized the importance of a great deal of out-of-class work. According to Treisman, the program resulted in Black students outperforming their white and Asian peers. This seems to support the results of studies showing that all students, especially students of color, benefit greatly from group learning (c.f. Springer, Stanne, &amp; Donovan, 1999, above).</div>
