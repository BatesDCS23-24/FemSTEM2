<li><div class="para">There are about 3.8 liters in a gallon and about 1.6 kilometers in a mile. If a car can travel 30 miles for every gallon of gas it burns, approximately how many kilometers can it travel per liter of gas? Just like in Section 2.1 of Common Sense Mathematics, write out your units and cancel units just like you would cancel zeroes in a fraction. Hint: start with <span class="process-math">\(30\frac{\text{miles}}{\text{gallon}}\text{.}\)</span> Then multiply by a number with units <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\text{kilometers}}{\text{miles}}\)</span> in order to cancel the miles and replace it with kilometers.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If a car can travel 30 miles per gallon of gas, how many gallons of gas does the car need to travel one mile? Show all work and units, cancelling units when needed.</div></li>
