<div class="para">The 2022 Trevor Project National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health (The Trevor Project 2022) found that 59% of young trans men and 48% of young trans women had considered suicide in the past year, while 22% of trans boys and 12% of trans girls had attempted suicide. The same survey found that 93% of trans and nonbinary youth said they had worried about legislation denying trans people access to gender-affirming healthcare.</div>

<div class="para">Service learning has been shown to provide an avenue to connect studentsâ€™ learning with their lives and, in doing so, enhances both. Particularly in math courses, service learning has given students new motivation to master the course content. At Concordia University Irvine, a small liberal arts university, the required core mathematics course recommends that students tutor elementary-aged homeless students in mathematics. The university claims that the tutoring gives students an opportunity to relearn and strengthen their mastery of basic math skills. Moreover, students reflect on their experiences through written and oral work, and this gives them an increased sense of personal efficacy, awareness of the world, and awareness of their own personal values. Students also reflected on the ways that the mathematical "life lessons" from the <em class="emphasis">Heart of Mathematics</em> textbook by Burger and Starbird were used during the tutoring. Overall, service learning seemed to promote a greater understanding of both mathematics and the importance of service.</div>
