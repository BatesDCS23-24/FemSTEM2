<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Drag performance</code> laws (perhaps better categorized as “gender expression laws”), a recent development as of 2023, ban drag shows or “male or female impersonators” in certain circumstances, such as “in the presence of minors” (Tennessee’s Senate Bill 3) or on Sundays from 1 a.m. to 12 p.m. (Arizona’s SB 1030). Laws barring municipalities from passing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">nondiscrimination protections</code>, as well as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">religious freedom</code> laws, legalize discrimination in certain circumstances against LGBTQ+ people, particularly by those with a “strongly felt religious conviction” that being LGBTQ+ is wrong. Finally, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">healthcare</code> laws prevent gender-affirming care for various groups in various ways, often including bans on hormone therapy and surgery for those under 18.</div>
