<li><div class="para">According to Moses, economic access is needed to lift marginalized and inner-city residents out of violence and criminalization.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Moses states that the need for “knowledge workers” is a primary trend of the contemporary economy, earning <span class="process-math">\(82\%\)</span> more than workers in other industries.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Moses argues that “illiteracy in math is acceptable the way illiteracy in reading and writing is unacceptable”, causing a socially-constructed lack of fluency in math.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">“Math illiteracy is not unique to Blacks the way the denial of the right to vote in Mississippi was. But it affects Blacks and other minorities much, much more intensely, making them the designated serfs of the information age just as the people that we worked with in the s on the plantations were Mississippi’s serfs then.”</div></li>
