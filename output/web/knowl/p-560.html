<li><div class="para">What are some types of graphs you have seen before? For each, what do you think that type of graph is useful for?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The data set includes the status of each bill. Review the dataset. What are the different statuses?</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Let’s generate a graph showing how many bills there are with each status. The following code comes from the programming language R: [INSERT CODE]. To generate a graph, replace the [INSERT LABEL] with one of the following:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">A bar graph: “geom_bar(stat = “identity”)”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A histogram: “geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A boxplot: “geom_boxplot()”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A line graph: “geom_line()”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A pie graph: This is the Nickelback of charts (see https://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A scatterplot: “geom_point()”</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question. Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">Now let us look at something else. For the following two pieces of data, generate each type of graph and answer the same questions from above: Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">The total number of bills proposed between 2018 and 2023.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The bills signed and enacted between 2018 and 2023.</div></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol></div>
