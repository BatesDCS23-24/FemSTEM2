<div class="para">The concept of teaching mathematics for social justice (TMSJ) is introduced as the use of mathematics both to provide students with the education necessary to succeed in the current system as well as "to critically analyze [students’] world to ultimately promote a democratic society in which all get an opportunity to participate fully". A growing number of researchers argue that TMSJ can support the "ongoing struggle for equity in mathematics education". This article presents a qualitative study of teachers in a graduate course learning to implement TMSJ. Although there are many conceptions of what "social justice" and "equity" are, the author draws her conception from Paulo Freire of an education "not to integrate those who are marginalized into the existing society but rather to change society so that all are included". Darling-Hammond’s (2002) model of equity pedagogy includes understanding of oneself in relation to others (Self), the power structures that interact with their understanding of pedagogy (Society), the ways that culture and context affect students (Students), and how to develop classroom practices that support their students (School). It seems to me that as students grow to understand mathematics as "useful in investigating the sociopolitical realities that shape their lives", we will see greater engagement by underrepresented students in mathematics, so that the dual goals of TMSJ are mutually reinforcing.</div>

<div class="para">This chapter of the workshop proceedings begins by quoting Marilyn Carlson that the debate between "teacher-directed instruction" and "student-centered discovery" is "distract[ing] the community with false dichotomies and vague premises", a polarizing position that may inadvertently discount quality scholarship. The authors continue by presenting two characterizations of student understanding of mathematical functions: Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) theory and covariation. APOS theory defines an "action" as a step-by-step transformation of a set of mathematical objects into another mathematical object; for instance, evaluating a composition of functions at the point x. In contrast, the "process stage" of understanding takes place when students "internalize the action into a process" and can then think about the process without performing it. The process stage entails a greater level of abstraction, e.g. finding a general formula for a composition of functions given data for each function in table or graph form. <em class="emphasis">Covariational reasoning</em> is defined as "the cognitive activities involved in coordinating two varying quantities while attending to the ways in which they change in relation to each other"; for instance, attending to parametric equations. Observations of students suggest that covariational processing involves five kinds of mental action; questioning strategies to promote each action in students are suggested. Finally, the authors discuss the balance of <em class="emphasis">social scaffolding</em> to keep a discussion moving and <em class="emphasis">analytic scaffolding</em> to keep a discussion mathematically productive and suggest requirements for an instructor to use analytic scaffolding successfully.</div>
