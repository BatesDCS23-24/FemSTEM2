<div class="para">Suppose that we have a bar graph that allows us to compare the numerical data of a particular variable (total number of passed bills from 2018 to 2023). Now consider another bar graph that compares the total number of introduced bills within this same time period. Finally, consider a third bar graph that compares the total number of bills that crossed over again during the same time period. Then we can hope to find a relationship between the proportions of bills which are crossed over or passed within each year as well as the trend over time as to what proportions are crossed over or passed. This can be done by using multiple bar graphs or a combined set of graphs which we call a <em class="emphasis">multigraph</em>.</div>
