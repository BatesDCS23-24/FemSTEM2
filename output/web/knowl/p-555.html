<div class="para">A common claim in the news media, and a common feeling among trans and nonbinary folks, is that 2023 is by far the worst recent year for anti-trans legislation. How do we explore if 2023 was the year of anti-trans legislation? This question is vague - what does an answer to this question mean? How do we use this information in our advocacy? In order to conduct research, we need to drill down into more specific questions that can be answered empirically. This is an important story in that we need to document hate in order to compare it to other cases of hate in the past and in the future. We are trying to understand broader patterns in order to better understand where our advocacy work may make a difference.</div>

<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Drag performance</code> laws (perhaps better categorized as “gender expression laws”), a recent development as of 2023, ban drag shows or “male or female impersonators” in certain circumstances, such as “in the presence of minors” (Tennessee’s Senate Bill 3) or on Sundays from 1 a.m. to 12 p.m. (Arizona’s SB 1030). Laws barring municipalities from passing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">nondiscrimination protections</code>, as well as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">religious freedom</code> laws, legalize discrimination in certain circumstances against LGBTQ+ people, particularly by those with a “strongly felt religious conviction” that being LGBTQ+ is wrong. Finally, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">healthcare</code> laws prevent gender-affirming care for various groups in various ways, often including bans on hormone therapy and surgery for those under 18.</div>
