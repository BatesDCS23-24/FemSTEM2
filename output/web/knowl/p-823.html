<div class="para logical"><ul class="circle">
<li>
<div class="para">Change the rules to make arithmetic easier. There weren’t exactly <span class="process-math">\(300\)</span> million Americans in <span class="process-math">\(2007\)</span>the actual population was something like <span class="process-math">\(301.2\)</span> million. But since we’re just giving an estimate anyway, we don’t care about the <span class="process-math">\(1.2\text{.}\)</span> We <dfn class="terminology">round</dfn> to the nearest hundred million!</div>
<div class="para logical"><ul class="square"><li><div class="para">For this reason, we only care about how many zeroes your answer has, not the actual number. So for our purposes <dfn class="terminology"><span class="process-math">\(1,000,000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(9,000,000\)</span> are the same</dfn> because they give us the answer of “millions”.</div></li></ul></div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Writing all those zeroes can get unwieldy, so we use <dfn class="terminology">scientific notation</dfn>: <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(14\)</span> zeroes after it is the same as <span class="process-math">\(1\times10^{14}\text{.}\)</span> Nine with seventy zeroes after it is written <span class="process-math">\(9\times10^{70}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Divide and conquer</dfn>: split the problem up by first figuring out all the things we need to know, then using those things in some order to get an answer.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Use ranges.</dfn> If you feel fairly confident that there are between <span class="process-math">\(1000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(300000\)</span> Americans who don’t like Harry Potter (between <span class="process-math">\(1\times10^{3}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\times10^{5}\)</span> in scientific notation), average the exponents and the single-digit numbers to get your estimate. Here we’d average <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> to get <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> so your answer would be <span class="process-math">\(2\times10^{4}=20,000\)</span> Americans.</div>
<div class="para logical"><ul class="square"><li><div class="para">This is called taking a <dfn class="terminology">geometric mean</dfn>, which is easier to take than a “regular” average when dealing with big numbers and exponents.</div></li></ul></div>

<li><div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Look up related data</dfn>, if it’s available, to check the reasonableness of your estimation. For example, when estimating the number of active COVID-19 cases in SLC, you could look up scientific estimates of the proportion of COVID-19 cases that are reported, multiply that proportion by the population of SLC, and see if it’s in the same ballpark (same number of zeroes) as your estimate.</div></li>
