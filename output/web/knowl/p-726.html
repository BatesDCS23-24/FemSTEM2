<div class="para">In this section of their book <em class="emphasis">Rethinking Mathematics</em>, Gutstein and Peterson argue that a social justice approach to mathematics benefits students by allowing them to recognize the importance of mathematics as an essential tool for understanding and potentially changing the world. Other benefits of this philosophy, according to the authors, include educating students about social issues, connecting mathematics with students’ cultural and community histories, increasing student participation in democracy, and increasing student motivation. No studies are cited to support these assertions, but anecdotal evidence is used throughout the book to justify them. The authors advise teachers to get to know their students and communities and to use the issues students bring up as springboards for math lessons. This fits with the idea, brought up in class, that students come in to a classroom with their own schemas for understanding the world, and that meeting the students where they are is the best educational philosophy. The authors point out that disadvantaged communities, those who are currently the target of outreach to improve retention and performance in math courses, are the ones whose experiences are privileged under this style of teaching, and thus that they may be more likely to learn math in a justice framework. Gutstein and Peterson argue that teaching math in a "neutral" way is not possible, because even trying to leave politics out of the classroom is a political decision that prevents questioning of the status quo.</div>

<div class="para">There are many reasons that an equity framework is useful for teaching mathematics. There is still substantial inequality within schools, as financially under-resourced schools have fewer highly-qualified teachers, and 83% of teachers are White. Many teacher training programs provide limited education about social justice or culturally relevant pedagogy, though researchers have confirmed that culturally relevant teaching practices contribute to educational equity (McGee 2014). Preservice teachers often view student diversity as a problem rather than a resource, and many teachers hold a view that "all students should be treated equally in the classroom", even when this leads to disproportionately negative outcomes for students of color (Rousseau &amp; Tate, 2003). This "one-size-fits-all" mentality is a common, serious obstacle to true teacher reflection and equity. Further, the "color-blind" mentality, in which a teacher claims "not to see color", leads to ignoring students’ cultural backgrounds in the classroom, thus leading to decreased student engagement, as well as a refusal to combat historical and actual racist practices (Rousseau &amp; Tate, 2003). In classroom observations, Rousseau &amp; Tate (2003) report several instances of students being "allowed to fail" through their teacher’s neglect; such students were disproportionately Black, specifically Black men.</div>
