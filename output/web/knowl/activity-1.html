<div class="para">\begin{enumerate} \item What are some types of graphs you have seen before? For each, what do you think that type of graph is useful for? \item The data set includes the status of each bill. \begin{enumerate} \item Review the dataset. What are the different statuses? \item Let’s generate a graph showing how many bills there are with each status. The following code comes from the programming language R: [INSERT CODE] To generate a graph, replace the [INSERT LABEL] with one of the following: \begin{itemize} \item A bar graph: “geom_bar(stat = “identity”)” \item A histogram: “geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)” \item A boxplot: “geom_boxplot()” \item A line graph: “geom_line()” \item A pie graph: This is the Nickelback of charts (see https://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6) \item A scatterplot: “geom_point()” \end{itemize} Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question. \item Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? \item What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023? \end{enumerate} \item Now let’s look at something else. Let’s look at the total number of bills proposed between 2018 and 2023. \begin{enumerate} \item Using the code below, generate each type of graph. Remember that some may throw errors because they aren’t appropriate. \item Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? \item What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question? \end{enumerate} \item Let’s look at all of the bills signed and enacted between 2018 and 2023. \begin{enumerate} \item Using the code below, generate each type of graph. Remember that some may throw errors because they aren’t appropriate. \item Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? \item What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question? \end{enumerate} \item Finally, let’s look at all of the bills signed and enacted between 2018 and 2023. \begin{enumerate} \item Using the code below, generate each type of graph. Remember that some may throw errors because they aren’t appropriate. \item Which graph do you think is the clearest? Why do you think that is? \item What do you notice from this graph?
