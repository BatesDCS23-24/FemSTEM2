		<div class="para">Try to create each type of graph in R. Some will cause errors - that is a sign that this type of graph isn’t appropriate for this question.</div>

		<div class="para">What do you notice from this graph? Does this tell you anything about our question regarding 2023?</div>  
		<div class="para">Now let us look at something else. Let us look at the total number of bills proposed between 2018 and 2023.</div>  
		<div class="para">Using the code below, generate each type of graph. Remember that some may throw errors because they aren’t appropriate.</div>
