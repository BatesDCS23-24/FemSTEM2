This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Visualizing the word vector output

### Summary of the data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Get a sense for the data through a table of word counts

# you will need a read command if you are just picking up from the cleaned text

ltext_df<-read.csv(file = billname)

#how many words are there? This may come up later
n_words <- dim(ltext_vec)[1]

# Use dplyr to automatically count the words that exist. This creates a table (in a dataframe structure) in which you have the list of unique words and an absolute frequency count next to each word.
ltext_counts <- ltext_df %>% count(words)

#relative freq
ltext_counts$relf <- ltext_counts$n / n_words
View(ltext_counts)

# use dim() to tell me how big the matrix is
print(dim(ltext_counts))

```

The first number is rows (67) and the second is columns (3). This means that our word vector contains 67 distinct words & 3 columns - the word, the absolute frequency or count, and the relative frequency or probability of occurance. 

Some methods of visualization, like the base plotting function in R, use this form of the data.


### Base plot in R
```{r}
# This is the base plotting function in R
barplot(height=ltext_counts$n, names=ltext_counts$words)

# Great reference
# https://r-graph-gallery.com/208-basic-barplot.html
```

This plot is illegible. Because it has 226 words. We can look instead at just the 20 most frequently used words.

### Top 20

```{r}
#This will order in descending order
counts_ordered <- ltext_counts %>% arrange(desc(n))
View(counts_ordered)

#This will extract the top 20 for visualization purposes
top20 <-  head(counts_ordered, 20)
top20
```


```{r}
# Same but top 20
barplot(height=top20$n, names=top20$words)

```

This is much better, but you cannot read the words, so we will have the words tilted for better readability
```{r}
# las 2 will make vertical labels
# col will make it a little less boring in color
barplot(height=top20$n, names=top20$words, las = 2, col=rgb(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.6) )

# Great reference for options
# https://r-graph-gallery.com/209-the-options-of-barplot.html
```

### Plot in ggplot2

ggplot2 can look prettier :)
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# ggplot2 version
# help guide: https://r-graph-gallery.com/218-basic-barplots-with-ggplot2.html
ggplot(top20, aes(x=words, y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

```

again the figure would be more easily read if the text was vertical
```{r}
ggplot(top20, aes(x=words, y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7), fill=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7)) +
# Rotate x-axis text to make labels vertical
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = NULL)  # or xlab("")

```

Reorder from biggest to smallest
```{r}
# This pulls the words as ordered
ordered.words <- top20 %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  pull(words)

# This will help ggplot interpret the words as factors, and in particular, factors with a particular order.
top20$words <- ordered(top20$words, levels = ordered.words)

top20 %>%
ggplot(aes(x=words, y=n)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7), fill=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7)) +
# Rotate x-axis text to make labels vertical
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = NULL)  # or xlab("")
```

Freq graph
```{r}
top20 %>%
ggplot(aes(x=words, y=relf)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7), fill=rgb(0.1,0.4,0.5,0.7)) +
# Rotate x-axis text to make labels vertical
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y= "Relative frequency")  # or xlab("")
```
